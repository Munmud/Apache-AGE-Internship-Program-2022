# [Question No. 3] Frontend Test - Use Google Map API to draw the Los Angeles Subway Network.

## Installation

- From command prompt go to project directory
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- visit : `http://localhost:3001/`

## Additional Information

- My Project doesn't have a billing account. So map will show with warning "For Development purposes only". If you want to add your own billing account/ api key then Create a js api key and insert it in index.html ` src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=``<key>``&callback=initMap" `
- All lat and lng can be found from `https://www.metro.net/riding/guide/how-ride-rail/`
